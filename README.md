The Machine Health Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution for diagnosing
and resolving issues in various types of machinery. Utilizing a graphical user interface built
with Tkinter, users can easily navigate and select specific machine types and associated
problems. Leveraging a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a dataset of machine types,
problems, and solutions, the system swiftly generates predictions for the identified issues.
Through dynamic updates and clear solution displays, users can efficiently troubleshoot and
maintain machinery, enhancing overall operational efficiency and reducing downtime. This
system serves as a valuable tool for industries and organizations seeking to streamline their
maintenance processes and ensure optimal performance of their equipment.
